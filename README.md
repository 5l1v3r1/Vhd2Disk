# Vhd2Disk

What Vhd2disk does?

It's a very basic V2P free tool to simply dump a VHD contents/structure to a physical drive.
It designed to work only with "dynamic" VHD like Disk2vhd's ouput. Vhd2disk was tested succefully on win7 and win2K8: Disk2vhd -> vhd used for virtualisation -> Vhd2disk.
This tool is working like a mirror of the Sysinternal's Disk2Vhd tool (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/ee656415).

Be caution using this tool since it will overwrite the data on the target drive.
If you play with it, I can't be responsive about any data lost.
